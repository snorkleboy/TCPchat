#TCPchat
###a tcp based server an client written in ruby that facilitates instant chat between users

##how to start

both folders come with a tcpserver.rb and a client.rb. Either can be started by simply calling "ruby tcpserver.rb port host". 
The port and host parameters are optional and default to 9876 'localhost'. The server can also be started with an optional third
parameter that will set the name of the server that users see. 

when you start the server you should see it tell you that it has bound a socket to a port and started listening, and has started a console. 
At that point the server is ready to accept connections and console commands

##client
simply make a tcp connection to the server and you will be prompted for a username and can request a list of signed on users. 
once signed on you can type messages to send in the cli and messages recieved will be tagged by author.

##console commands

###see
shows a list of users and running threads. Note that the server is always user[0].

###diss
closes all connections in the User pool

###myip
outputs your IP 

###msg 'your message here'
broadcasts any string that comes after msg to all users. Note that you do not need to wrap your message in quotes, and it
will be ouputed as 'serverName: your message.

##future 

- chatrooms
- better console commands
- make basic app that responds
